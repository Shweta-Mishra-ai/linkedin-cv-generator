## 🌟 Overview

**CareerForge_AI** extracts unstructured data from LinkedIn profiles and converts it into a professional, print-ready HTML CV. It is designed to be resilient, bypass anti-bot mechanisms, and leverage Google's Gemini AI for perfect data structuring.

## ✨ Key Features

- 📄 **Bulletproof PDF Parsing** — Bypass LinkedIn's strict anti-bot mechanisms entirely by uploading a native LinkedIn Profile PDF export. **100% reliable.**
- 🔗 **Smart URL Scraping** — Features an intelligent URL scraper that uses Googlebot header spoofing and URL slug parsing as a fallback if LinkedIn blocks the request.
- 🧠 **AI-Driven Extraction** — Powered by **Google's Gemini API** (`gemini-pro` / `gemini-1.5-flash`) to intelligently read raw, messy text and structure it into perfect JSON (Name, Headline, Skills, Experience).
- 🎨 **Pro-Level Design Template** — It doesn't just dump plain text. It generates a beautifully formatted, **Canva-style HTML resume** that is instantly ready to be saved as a PDF (Ctrl+P).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

- **Frontend & Hosting:** [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) (Python)
- **Data Extraction:** BeautifulSoup4, Requests
- **PDF Processing:** PyPDF2
- **AI Engine:** Google Generative AI (Gemini API)
- **Document Generation:** HTML/CSS with Base64 encoding for direct downloads

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shweta-Mishra-ai/CareerForge_AI.git
   cd CareerForge_AI
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up your API Key:**
   Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file in the root directory and add your Google Gemini API key:
   ```toml
   GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

## 🧠 Why This Approach?

Directly scraping LinkedIn URLs from a cloud server often results in immediate IP bans (HTTP 999/403 errors). To solve this real-world engineering problem, this application prioritizes the **PDF Upload method** for guaranteed **100% uptime**, while maintaining a smart **URL Parsing fallback** to fulfill basic scraping requirements without crashing the app.

4. **Download your CV** as a beautiful HTML file or save it directly as a PDF (Ctrl+P).
